## Overview

Arizona Broadcast is a high-performance Discord broadcasting system designed to handle large scale message delivery using multiple bot tokens.

The system distributes workloads automatically across an available token fleet using intelligent balancing, asynchronous processing, and structured error management.

### Asynchronous Processing Queue

A controlled queue engine built for efficiency:

- Concurrent task execution
- Parallel direct message handling
- Optimized processing flow
- Rate limit aware execution

---

### Advanced Terminal Logging

Clean runtime monitoring:

- Structured console output
- Delivery status tracking
- Failed request detection
- Gateway and client error reports

---

### Persistent Error Tracking

Reliable state management:

- Stores failed recipients
- Maintains retry data
- Prevents lost broadcast progress

---

### Secure Architecture

Designed with credential protection:

- Environment variable isolation
- Protected token storage
- Source control safety
